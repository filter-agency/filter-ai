You can obtain an API key by signing up at the respective service&#39;s website.</p> <p>= Is the plugin free to use? =</p> <p>Yes, the Filter AI plugin is completely free to use. You only pay for the AI service API usage according to the provider&#39;s pricing model.</p> <p>= Can I customise the AI prompts? =</p> <p>Absolutely!
